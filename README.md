### Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Logan. Messing with computers has long been a hobby of mine. Here you can see a small subset of what I do with my free time.

Here are some quick facts about me:
- I use Linux (a lot)
  - I have used Linux based OSs for almost 10 years, and I finally ditched Windows 2 years ago
- I mostly program in ![Python Logo](/images/python.svg)Python and ![Bash Logo](/images/bash.svg)Bash
- [Codeveloped and released the first publically available temproot exploit for a Verizon BL locked Pixel 2](https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2-xl/how-to/temporary-magisk-root-vzw-pixel-2-xl-xl-t3981423)
- Currently studying to become a Nuclear Engineer
